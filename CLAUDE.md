# Claude Code Instructions for the dryopea Project

## What dryopea is

**dryopea** is a sci-fi free-build / tower-defence game built on
[loft](https://github.com/jjstwerff/loft).  The defining mechanic
is **scramble-and-salvage**: when a base is about to be overrun,
the player fires a rocket out of the core building and evacuates
key components — each carried-out component disables the tower
it came from, so grabbing salvage *hastens* the overrun.
Evacuated components give an advantage at the next base.  A run
is a sequence of bases, chained by what you carry out.

**Status: active implementation.**  Plan 01 (in-game ground-type
editor) has shipped E1–E4 + an integration smoke test + the
runnable E1-live editor (`src/main.loft`).  72/72 tests green
under `scripts/test.sh`.  Plan 06 (editor-to-stencil pipeline)
is drafted and waits on loft `lib_plan 24` for the shared
substrate.  The full design lives in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md);
the fiction in [`docs/SETTING.md`](docs/SETTING.md); the full
feature roadmap in [`plans/ROADMAP.md`](plans/ROADMAP.md).

## Relationship to loft

loft is the language + runtime; dryopea is a consumer project.
Dryopea is also the **second partner** for loft's universal
hex-world editor (loft `lib_plan 24`) — moros is the first;
dryopea drives the bug-hunt phase that hardens the shared
libraries.

When dryopea surfaces a need from loft — a language feature, a
stdlib gap, a runtime bug — file it in
[`QUESTIONS_FOR_LOFT.md`](QUESTIONS_FOR_LOFT.md).  Do **not** fix
it locally by patching loft from this repo; loft has its own
contribution flow.  Internal-to-dryopea bugs go in
[`PROBLEMS.md`](PROBLEMS.md) with `@D<NNN>` IDs.

## Key commands

```bash
# Build the loft binary (needed by scripts/test.sh; ~20s release build)
cd ~/Documents/loft && cargo build --release

# Run dryopea's test suite (canonical entry — DO NOT run `loft test` directly)
scripts/test.sh

# Run the interactive editor (E1-live; opens a 960x720 GL window)
~/Documents/loft/target/release/loft --lib ~/Documents/loft/lib src/main.loft

# Parse-check a single .loft file without running it
~/Documents/loft/target/release/loft --native-emit /tmp/check.rs \
    --lib ~/Documents/loft/lib src/<file>.loft
```

`scripts/test.sh` is the canonical test runner.  It:
- Pre-cleans `tests/actual/*.png` and `tests/actual/*.json`
  between runs so stale artefacts can't masquerade as current.
- Invokes `loft test --lib ~/Documents/loft/lib --no-warnings`
  against the dryopea `tests/` directory.
- Exit code 0 = all green; non-zero = failures (the loft test
  runner surfaces assertion failures as FAIL since `@P367`
  shipped on the loft side).

## Architecture — src/ layout

```
src/
  dryopea.loft     library aggregator — `use dryopea;` brings every
                   submodule into scope (tests use this entry)
  main.loft        interactive editor entry point — `fn main()`,
                   NOT in the aggregator (runs via `loft src/main.loft`)
  world.loft       hex math (axial flat-top); HEX_DIAMETER = 1.5m;
                   cube_round_axial, world_to_hex, visible_hexes
  camera.loft      EditorCamera { pos: Hex, zoom: integer }
                   + InputState (moros-style: factories + pure tick
                   + struct of booleans)
                   + camera_update(c: &EditorCamera, input: InputState)
  painted.loft     PaintedHex { q, r, kind: u8 }
                   + PaintedWorld { painted: hash<PaintedHex[q, r]> }
                   + paint(), lookup_painted(), paint_line()
                   (sea-default sparse storage — un-painted hex is sea)
  palette.loft     GroundType { name, color, sub_palette, slope, drop,
                   drainage, walk_*, buildable }
                   + load_palette(path) via `text as vector<GroundType>`
                   + parse_hex_color()
  picker.loft      Picker { palette, active }
                   + picker_default(), picker_set_active(),
                   render_picker(cv, p, x0, y0) — Canvas-painted UI
  render.loft      software rasterizer using graphics::Canvas
                   + render_to_canvas, render_with_hover, palette_color,
                   draw_hex, draw_hex_outline,
                   world_to_canvas, screen_to_world, screen_to_hex
  golden.loft      assert_golden(cv, name) — writes tests/actual/<n>.png,
                   asserts byte-equality against tests/golden/<n>.png;
                   FAILs via loft's now-working assert (@P367 fixed)
  map_file.loft    MapFile { version, name, cam_q, cam_r, cam_zoom,
                   ground: vector<GroundEntry> }
                   — 6 fields, flat, vector LAST — see § Known constraints
  save.loft        paint_to_mapfile, save_map_file, load_map_file,
                   mapfile_to_painted, palette_index_of,
                   save_world, load_map_or_empty (returns tuple)
```

Tests live in `tests/01_*.loft` (one file per phase).  Goldens
live in `tests/golden/` (committed); actuals in `tests/actual/`
(gitignored).

## Key data structures

| Type | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Hex` | `world.loft` | `{ q, r }` axial flat-top coord |
| `EditorCamera` | `camera.loft` | `{ pos: Hex, zoom: integer }` |
| `InputState` | `camera.loft` | per-frame action flags (in_pan_*, in_zoom_*) |
| `PaintedHex` | `painted.loft` | `{ q, r, kind: u8 }` — one painted cell |
| `PaintedWorld` | `painted.loft` | wrapper holding `hash<PaintedHex[q, r]>` |
| `GroundType` | `palette.loft` | one row from `examples/palette.json` |
| `Picker` | `picker.loft` | palette UI state |
| `MapFile` | `map_file.loft` | save record (6 fields; see Known constraints) |
| `GroundEntry` | `map_file.loft` | one persisted hex with kind as text name |

## Important conventions

### Hex convention

Axial flat-top hex grid throughout — matches moros and loft
`lib_plan 24`.  HEX_DIAMETER = 1.5m vertex-to-vertex.  World
+y grows **south** (same direction as canvas +y); there is no
y-flip in the render path.

### Naming

- Functions, variables: `lower_case`
- Types, structs, enums: `CamelCase`
- Constants (file-scope): `UPPER_CASE`
- Loop variables prefixed per function (`tslr_w`, `tpi_pal`)
  to dodge the flat-namespace gotcha
- `dryopea_*` save path is local-cwd-relative + gitignored

### Test discipline (moros-style)

- Factories for state construction (`camera_default()`,
  `painted_empty()`, `picker_default(path)`).
- Pure tick functions: `camera_update(c: &EditorCamera, input: InputState)`.
- `InputState` is a struct of named boolean fields, not a flag
  bitmask.  Tests construct it directly + assert on field changes.
- Golden-image tests via `assert_golden(cv, name)` — render to
  Canvas, write to `tests/actual/<n>.png`, compare bytes to
  `tests/golden/<n>.png`.  Bootstrapping a new golden: run, FAIL,
  review `tests/actual/<n>.png`, copy to `tests/golden/<n>.png`.

### Loft language gotchas we hit

The following are dryopea-side workarounds for known loft
behaviour.  Full reproducers + loft-side issue refs live in
[`QUESTIONS_FOR_LOFT.md`](QUESTIONS_FOR_LOFT.md):

- **`now` is a builtin** (`default/02_images.loft`).  Don't
  use as a local variable name — shadowing confuses type
  inference and your `now = ticks()` ends up holding a `fn() ->
  integer` reference rather than its result.  We renamed to
  `tnow` in `src/main.loft`.
- **`graphics::KEY_*` need explicit qualification.** Bare-name
  UPPER_CASE constants without `pub` don't re-export across
  `use` chains.  `gl_key_pressed(graphics::KEY_W)` works;
  `gl_key_pressed(KEY_W)` doesn't.
- **JSON cast HANGS on ≥8 declared fields with a
  `vector<Struct>`.**  `text as MapFile` with 10 fields hangs
  forever; 7 fields work.  MapFile is constrained to 6 fields
  until the loft fix ships.
- **`:j` formatter omits empty fields** (empty strings, empty
  vectors, zero ints under some conditions).  Round-trip
  `save → load` of a struct with empty fields can produce JSON
  the cast can't reload.  We avoid empty fields in MapFile.
- **Empty `[]` after a text field in JSON corrupts the prior
  field on cast.**  `{"name":"b","items":[]}` reads back as
  `name=""`.  We keep vectors non-empty (or put them first).
- **Early `return (a, b)` of a tuple of two struct types fails
  type-check**, despite the if-else *expression* form of the
  same tuple working.  In `load_map_or_empty` we use the
  if-else expression form, not early return.
- **`text as Struct` cast IGNORES unknown JSON fields**
  (lenient — @P366 fixed).  We rely on this for forward-compat
  saves.
- **Loop variable name reuse must keep consistent type per
  function-scope** — different types in different loops fails
  ("loop variable 'i' has type text but was previously used as
  integer").  Prefix loop vars per function.

### Save path

The interactive editor saves to `dryopea_save.json` in the
cwd.  Tests write to `tests/actual/*.json` (also gitignored).
Both paths are blown away between runs by `scripts/test.sh`.

**Eventual destination:** path-backed mmap'd `Store` (the hash
IS the file — no save loop).  Rust side ships; loft `.loft`
language surface for binding user-data Stores to a path is
missing.  Filed in [`QUESTIONS_FOR_LOFT.md` § Path-backed
user-data Store binding](QUESTIONS_FOR_LOFT.md); strategy in
[`plans/ROADMAP.md` § Persistence destination](plans/ROADMAP.md).
**Don't take the manual binary `file()` + `#read` detour** —
it's strictly worse than the JSON we have today.

### Plan numbering

**Never renumber existing plans.**  New plans get the next
unused integer.  Plan 01 = ground editor (active); plans 02-06
= drafted in `plans/future/`.  Numbering is independent of
priority — `plans/ROADMAP.md` carries the logical ordering.

## Loft consumer relationship + library dependency

- **Today:** dryopea consumes `lib/graphics` from
  `~/Documents/loft/lib/graphics` via path-dep in `loft.toml`.
- **Soon (when loft lib_plan 24 ships):** dryopea consumes
  `hex_grid`, `hex_map`, `hex_render`, `hex_stencil`,
  `hex_editor`, `hex_entity` — the universal hex-world editor
  substrate extracted from moros.  See
  [loft lib_plans/24-universal-editor/REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/jjstwerff/loft/tree/main/doc/claude/lib_plans/future/24-universal-editor)
  for the extraction architecture.
- **Plan 06 explicitly depends on lib_plan 24.**  Without the
  extraction, plan 06 either reimplements or copy-pastes moros
  code into dryopea — neither acceptable.

## Branch policy

### Current phase — pre-game-shippable: commit + push directly to `main`

**Until a runnable game build exists, direct commits to `main`
are the normal flow.**  The repo is small, single-author, and
the cost of branching ceremony outweighs its benefit while the
foundation is being laid.  Commit locally, push when the user
asks — no automatic pushes.

**Trigger for switching to the formal flow below:** the moment
there's a runnable game — even a minimum-playable validation —
this section is retired and the **MANDATORY** rules below
become the policy.

### Future phase — once a runnable game exists — MANDATORY

**Direct commits to `main` will not be allowed.**

All changes — features, design updates, plan edits — must land
on a feature branch and reach `main` only through a pull
request.  CI gates each PR.  `main` becomes the release branch.

#### Rules (active once the policy switches)

1. **Never `git commit` directly on `main`.**  If you accidentally
   land on `main`, move the change to a feature branch before
   anything else.
2. **Pushing commits is OK by default — unless there's an open PR
   on the branch that the push would disturb.**  For a long-lived
   working branch with no open PR, push freely after each green
   commit.  When the branch has an open PR, do NOT push without
   an explicit user instruction.
3. **Never create a branch or open a PR unless the user
   explicitly asks.**  "Implement plan 01 phase E1" is *not* a
   PR instruction.  Only run `gh pr create` or `git checkout -b`
   after the user explicitly says "create PR", "open a PR",
   "merge", or "switch to a new branch".
4. Default branch name for general work: a GENERAL slug
   (`work`, `cleanup`, `housekeeping`).  ONLY a substantial plan
   earns a specific branch name.
5. Merging to `main` is via a GitHub pull request — not a local
   `git merge`.

## Git safety — MANDATORY

### Never use `git stash pop` or `git pull` with uncommitted changes

Both can produce unrecoverable working-directory states.  Always
commit before any operation that changes the working tree.  To
compare with main, use `git diff main -- <file>` or `git show
origin/main:<file>` — no branch switch needed.

### Never use `git bisect` or `git checkout HEAD -- <files>`

Both routinely destroy multi-session work-in-progress.  To
investigate a regression, read the relevant code paths directly
or use `git show <commit>` / `git diff <commit>^ <commit>`.

## Documentation validation

We **don't** have a loft-style `@P` tracker + `./scripts/idx`
indexer yet.  Triggers for adding one:

- First dryopea-side P-issue gets numerous enough that prose
  references stop being practical (PROBLEMS.md currently has
  zero `@D` rows; trigger fires somewhere around ~20).
- Documentation count crosses ~25 (currently ~12).
- A specific drift incident makes the manual scan painful.

Until then: keep cross-references prose-form (§ section names)
+ explicit relative-path markdown links.  Run `scripts/test.sh`
before committing — it's the only doc-adjacent automation we
have today (validates tests via assert_golden + the loft test
runner).
